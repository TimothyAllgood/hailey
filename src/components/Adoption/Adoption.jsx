        Grafted in.
        <br />
        <br />
        The deepest and strongest foundation of adoption is God calling us His
        sons and daughters. Like branches of a wild vine, He made a way for us
        to be in His family tree. He modeled for us how, and now we understand a
        little bit more just a fraction of His love for us.
        <br />
        <br />
        Everyday we celebrate the bravery of her birth mom, the trusting of this
        little girl, the surrendering of our fears.
        <br />
        <br />
        We celebrate the miracle of adoption, birthed in heartache and pain but
        delivered in hope and redemption.
        <br />
        <br />
        We celebrate the story only God could write. The better story. The story
        where He gets the glory, the credit, and the honor.
        <br />
        <br />
        We celebrate the longing, waiting, and hard nights for wanting a family.
        We celebrate how God and God alone made it happen.
        <br />
        <br />
        We celebrate her life every day. Forever our daughter, but first and
        foremost Godâ€™s baby girl.
