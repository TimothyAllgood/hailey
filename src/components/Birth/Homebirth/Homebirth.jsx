      <h2>My Home Birth</h2>
      My name is Hailey Joy Miranda Aliff, and I am a trained and certified
      doula and childbirth educator as well as a full-time student midwife. I
      offer many services both individually and within packages including labor
      doula services, pregnancy and newborn photography, placenta preparation
      and essential oils. I am also a midwife-in-training and have a full-time
      apprenticeship with local homebirth LM, CPM Emmy Trammell.

      Joy Within Birth Services is the result of a long-time dream of mine. In
      just a couple of years, I will be a Certified Professional Midwife and
      more specifically, a very proud second generation midwife! As a young
      child I followed my momma around Southern California as she delivered many
      babies in homes. I grew up thinking birth was a beautiful miracle, a
      sacred event that every person in the family could experience together.
      Yet as I got older, I discovered that an entirely other childbirthing
      world existed where the media and society enforced scarce-tactics and
      convinced many women that childbirth is inherently dangerous, painful and
      something to be feared.
      <br />
      <br />
      I went to Millsaps College with pre-med intentions and graduated with my
      Bachelors Degree of Science in Biology in May of 2011. I spent a good part
      of my junior and senior years shadowing various OBGYNs in hospitals around
      the Jackson area. During this experience, I was able to really be a part
      of the medicalization of childbirth and I quickly discovered that the
      culture of birth was very different than I knew it to be. Birth could be
      better. And birth CAN be better! I know this for a fact.
      <br />
      <br />
      Once I realized that being an OBGYN was not necessarily my calling, I
      still wanted to play a role in normalizing birth. I then contemplated
      Nurse-Midwifery which led me on a full-circle journey to now pursuing
      direct-entry Midwifery. I could not be happier with what I am learning and
      what I am a part of.
      <br />
      <br />
      My role as a doula is to help you feel confident in yourself, your body
      and the birthing process; to help you enjoy your birth experience and to
      bring you satisfaction in what takes place. My goal is to empower you
      through your experience by educating you, informing you about the choices
      you have, and making your birth experience one that you and your family
      will treasure forever.
