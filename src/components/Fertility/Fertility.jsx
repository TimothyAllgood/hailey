      <h2>Our Fertility Story</h2>
      <p>
        This is God’s beautiful story and we are so honored to tell it! He led
        us into a winter for six years and He NEVER left our side. He spoke to
        us and comforted us and let us grow in unimaginable ways. He called us
        to adopt first and healed our hearts in the process. And then springtime
        came and He opened my womb and delivered His promise to us. My mind can
        hardly wrap around this miracle 😭 Thank you Jesus!!!!!!
        <br />
        <br />
        After 77 cycles of trying, WE CONCEIVED! When this miracle babe is born,
        we will have been married 7 years. We found out on 11/7 and we are due
        on Emerson’s second birthday in July. How’s that for a bunch of sevens?!
        <br />
        <br />
        July was always a pain month for us. When we decided to “stop
        preventing” one year after we were married (so July 2014), we thought
        we’d get pregnant immediately. Every July – year after year after year
        after year – was a painful sting reminding us that our heart’s desire
        still hadn’t come to fruition. THEN in July 2018 our first miracle baby
        was born. Emerson Faith totally and completely redeemed july 😭 and
        wouldn’t it be just like God to give us ANOTHER July gift?! His love is
        evident in every detail, His purpose so sweet making all this waiting so
        darn worth it 🙌🏼🙏🏻
